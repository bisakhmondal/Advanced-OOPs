Developing an intelligent dialogue system 1 that not only emulates human conversation, but also
answers questions on topics ranging from latest news about a movie star to Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity,
and fulfills complex tasks such as travel planning, has been one of the longest running goals
in AI. The goal has remained elusive until recently. We are now observing promising results both in
academia sindustry, as large amounts of conversational data become available for training, and the
breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) are applied to conversational
AI.
